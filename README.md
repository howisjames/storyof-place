# James' Notesw on this Fork

## Data Source

Data is a json file contained in /data/ and named stores.json
Data fields with examples are:

    "shopName": "McDonald's Messe Vienna",
    "shopAddress": "Ausstellungsstra√üe 44A",
    "shopPLZ": "1020 Vienna",
    "shopCountry": "Austria",
    "shopLatitude": "48.217461",
    "shopLongitude": "16.405981",
    "shopActive": true
	
The index file loads the contents into a variable with the following line
"{{ $shops := .Site.Data.stores }}"
It provides a search field and determines sort order of the list.

A partial named js.html contains the script which creates and populates the map.
Numerous Leaflet settings can be adjusted here.
